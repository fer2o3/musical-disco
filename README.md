[The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) are practical cryptography exercises focused on breaking flawed implementations.

## Usage

This repository contains my solutions to these challenges written in Rust, here's how you can try them out :

```bash
cargo run --release --bin 01 # To run a challenge
cargo test --release --lib   # To run library tests
```

## Progress

If everything goes as planned, I should complete about one challenge every week. Here's a recap of everything solved so far :
